# Exploring-Road-Safety-Trends: A-Tableau-Dashboard
Tableau Dashboard preparation practice Project.

This Tableau Dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of road safety trends using a dataset on accidents downloaded from kaggle.com. By leveraging the power of data visualization, I have tried to provide insights into key factors influencing accident, their frequency and potential pattern. This dashboard is totally interactive and user can hover over the data points for detail information and apply filters to focus on specific regions or time periods and customize their view for a tailored analysis. 

I build this dashboard for practice purpose and uploaded all the required file for the reference.
